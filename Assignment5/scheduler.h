 * Stats of the scheduler simulator run, airthmentic means at the top level, 
 * individual threads at the second level. 
 * 
 * For example, in a mildly JSON like syntax, stats for a run with two threads:
 * 
 *  {
 *    Mean waiting time  
 *    Mean turnaround time
 *    thread count = 2
 *    [  
 *      { 
 *        tid of T1
 *        Waiting time for T1
 *        Turnaround time for T1
 *      },
 *      { 
 *        tid of T2
 *        Waiting time for T2
 *        Turnaround time for T2
 *      }
 *    ]
 *  }
 * 
 * Assuming a linked list of thread data your scheduler added to and maintained
 * whilst the simulation was running, you'd create a stats object like so:
 * 
 *   ( Note that 'list' and 'size_of_list()' are yours to implement )
 * 
 *   int thread_count = size_of_list(list); 
 *   stats_t *stats = malloc(sizeof(stats_t));
 *   stats->tstats = malloc(sizeof(stats_t)*thread_count);
 * 
 * Then you'd fill in the individual stats->tstats[0..thread_count-1] records 
 * for each thread and set the mean waiting and turnaround times on stats itself.
